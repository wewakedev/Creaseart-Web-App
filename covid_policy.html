                At Aftercare, we are doing all in our power to help our community — our customers, delivery partners,
                and laundry & dry-cleaning merchants who have been hit the hardest during Covid-19 period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here's a rundown of everything we're doing right now to help our neighbourhood and our own business —
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="my-5">
            <h5>For our customers</h5>
            <div class="my-3">
                <p><b>Contactless Delivery</b> — Given the past lockdown scenario in India, we prioritise the delivery
                    of safe,
                    sanitary items to our customers. To that end, we have implemented contactless delivery. Customers
                    can choose to have the clothes left at a distance from the customer by the delivery partner,
                    ensuring no human-to-human connection and thereby minimising the chance of any transmission.
                </p>
                <p><b>Face masks</b> - We think that masks should be worn for the sake of others, if not for their own.
                    In that
                    spirit, we have supplied and will continue to offer face masks to our delivery partners in order to
                    protect them and our clients against the spread of an improbable infection. <br>
                    We are also constantly teaching our delivery partners on hygienic habits (such as avoiding touching
                    their faces or noses, sneezing in their elbows, and so on) to ensure their own and the ecosystem's
                    safety.

                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Disabling COD</b> — We've temporarily blocked the CoD (cash-on-delivery) feature on our app for
                    safety
                    concerns, to avoid communication between our users and delivery partners.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Strict hygiene requirements in laundry & dry-cleaning shops</b> - We are making a strong push to
                    guarantee that laundry & dry-cleaning shops obey hygiene standards and that information is passed on
                    to users so that they can make an educated decision and be confident of the safety and cleanliness
                    standards. <br><br>
                    Laundry & dry-cleaning shops can self-certify if they are following best measures recommended by WHO
                    on their premises to prevent the transmission of Coronavirus.
                    Laundry & dry-cleaning shops have installed hand washing and sanitation facilities. <br><br>
                    Laundry & dry-cleaning shops are now assessing the body temperatures of their delivery partners at
                    the time of pickup and delivery to guarantee that items are not delivered by someone who has a
                    higher than usual body temperature.
                    <br>
                    Delivery partners are required to give a daily self-assessment of their wellness – normal body
                    temperature, sanitised masks and bags.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    That's all for now. If there is anything further you believe we can or should do, please email us at
