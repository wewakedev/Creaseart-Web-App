            <h4>Policy regarding cancellations and refunds :</h4>
            <ul style="list-style-type: upper-roman !important; padding-left: 1rem; font-family: 'Montserrat';">
                <li>You acknowledge that (1) your cancellation, attempted or purported cancellation of an order, or (2)
                    cancellation due to reasons not attributable to Aftercare, such as providing incorrect particulars,
                    contact number, pick-up, and delivery address, etc., or being unresponsive, not reachable, or
                    unavailable for fulfilment of the services offered to you, shall constitute a breach of your
                    unconditional and irrevocable authorization in favour of Aftercare to place that order. If you
                    commit an Authorization Breach, you will be required to pay liquidated damages in the amount of the
                    order value. <br>
                    You thus permit Aftercare to recover or collect the amount owed as liquidated damages in any manner
                    Aftercare deems appropriate, including, but not limited to, deducting such amount from any payment
                    made towards your future Order.
                </li>
                <li> There may be times when Aftercare is unable to accept your order or cancels it owing to factors
                    such as technical faults, unavailability of your requested laundry & dry-cleaning service providers,
                    or any other reason attributable to Aftercare, Laundry & dry cleaning vendor, or Rider. In such
                    instances, Aftercare will not charge you a cancellation fee. <br>
                    If you cancel your order after payment has been charged and you are entitled for a refund of the
                    order value or a portion of it, the money will be refunded to you.
                </li>
                <li>Without the authorization of the laundry & dry-cleaning service provider, no refund / or other
                    settlement will be offered.
                </li>
                <li>If you have a complaint about an order, including but not limited to clothes damage, unfollowed
                    instruction, delivery of the wrong order, you must present proof of the same before any resolution
                    may be granted.
                </li>
                <li>You are not entitled to a refund if the instructions you provided with your order are not fulfilled
                    in the form and manner you intended. The laundry & dry-cleaning service provider will do their
                    utmost to follow the instructions.
                </li>
                <li>All refunds will be processed in the same manner in which they were received, unless refunds have
                    been granted to You in the form of credits, in which case the refund amount will be reflected in
                    your account in accordance with the relevant banks' rules.
                </li>
                <li>The user refund procedure on the Debit/Credit cards bank Payment Gateway may take 5-7 working days
                    to complete. We'll send the customer an email with a printout of the refund advice from the
                    Debit/Credit Cards bank payment gateway as a reference in case the user wants to notify the bank. If
                    the bank fails to credit the user's account with the amount already paid, the user must follow up
                    with the bank.
