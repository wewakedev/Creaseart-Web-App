        <div class="my-4">
            <h6>You are entitled to privacy.</h6>
            <p>We treat your data with care and discretion. That is ensured by our rules and compliance processes. If
                you have any queries or issues, please do not hesitate to contact us via email at

        <div class="my-4">
            <h6>How Do You Manage Your Data? </h6>
            <p>You have complete control over your personal information. You have the freedom to exercise your rights
                and alter your preferences at any time.

            <h6>Requests for Data Subject Rights </h6>
            <p>Depending on where you registered, your Aftercare account may allow you to view your information and make
                changes to or remove your data. If not, you may submit a request for access, deletion, or rectification,
                or object to our use of your email address or phone number.
            </p>
            <p>You may also request that we discontinue sending you email and text messages.</p>
            <p>Please be aware that we may need to retain certain information to respect your preferences (e.g., if you
                tell us to stop sending marketing emails, we will need your email address on file so that our systems
                remember that you no longer wish to receive marketing communications to that email address).

        <div class="my-4">
            <h6>How We Collect and Use Data </h6>
            <p>We, like all companies, acquire data when you engage with us or share data that can be shared with us. We
                do this with sensitivity and caution to preserve your rights. Data may help you understand yourself
                better as a consumer and as a person. We can use the information we have independently or in combination
                to provide you with better services, and experiences.

                computer's browser) to tell us what browser and operating system you're using, your IP address, the
                websites you visit, the links you click, and whether or not you've opened an email from us.

            <p>This information might include your phone, information about your phone's operating system, how you use
                the app, and your actual location. You will receive a pop-up notification on your phone with the choice
                to accept or refuse to enable us to know your exact geolocation (exactly where you are standing or where
                you are accessing the internet).
